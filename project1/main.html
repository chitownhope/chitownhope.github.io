<!-- the TRUNK modal stuff -->
<div id="trunk"><!-- i am the trunk --></div>
	
	<div id="modal-trunk">
	    <!-- HIDDEN POP UP DIV -->
		<div id="trunk-pop-up">
		  <p>
		    Now, this trunk may be the key to break this case wide open...It's locked now, but The Butler and M. Reina are said to be looking for the key.  Both seem to be trying very hard to appear cooperative.

<!-- the TELESCOPE modal stuff -->
<div id="telescope"><!-- im the telescope --></div>
	 
	<div id="modal-telescope">
	    <!-- HIDDEN POP UP DIV -->
		<div id="telescope-pop-up">
		  <p>
		    No one really knows how or why this telescope was moved from the estate's observatory to up here....M. Reina thinks the Butler must have moved it to gain a better view on the lands he says were promised to him by Old Man Danzy for all of his years of servitude. The Butler says he is being framed.

<!-- the BROWN-BEAR modal stuff -->

	 <div id="modal-brown-bear">
	    <!-- HIDDEN POP UP DIV -->
		<div id="brown-bear-pop-up">
		  <p>
		    Lots of old things in this attic...nothing new there...but, M. Reina is said to be especially attached to this old lovey of a bear...so, why is it up here?  Why would Madame Reina be spending time in this dusty old attic?

<!-- the RED CHAIR modal stuff -->
<div id="red-chair"><!-- i am the red chair --></div>
	
	<div id="modal-red-chair"> 
	    <!-- HIDDEN POP UP DIV -->
		<div id="red-chair-pop-up">
		  <p>
		    This old chair used to be a fav of Old Man Danzy.  It's only been a month since his passing.  Wonder who put it up here in the attic so soon...could this be a sign of someone wanting to remove all signs of the old man? M. Reina? the Butler?? Both have motives...

	    <!-- HIDDEN POP UP DIV -->
		<div id="green-phone-pop-up">
		  <p>
		    This is no clue...just an old phone...it's not even connected and it came up clean for fingerprints.

	 <div id="modal-big-trophy">
	    <!-- HIDDEN POP UP DIV -->
		<div id="big-trophy-pop-up">
		  <p>
		    An old tennis trophy from M. Reina's professional tennis days...The Butler's finger prints are the only ones on it...he claims to not have moved it up here.  M. Reina says she didnt move it and this is proof of the Butler's jealousy of her.
